# hc-authly-playlist-guesser

Log in by guessing my playlist. Made for [Hack Club's Authly YSWS](https://authly.hackclub.com). Made with Vue.js

This is a fun, quirky, and probably impractical login system. It uses a playlist as a password, and you have to guess the correct songs and their order to log in. For simplicity, the possible songs are limited to a predefined list.
